# Food-Ordering-Website
This is a Food Ordering Website. 
The website was made by me for Frontend practice in my initial phase.
### It doesn't make use of things like Bootstrap, Material UI or any other CSS framework.
Making it a brilliant project for revisiting the basics. Whether it is the working of a Flex-Box or using Z-index effectively or any other basic practice. This project surely is a bliss.
